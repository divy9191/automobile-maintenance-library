# Technical Project Overview: Automobile Maintenance Library

This automobile maintenance tracking system demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of object-oriented programming principles in C++ with a modern web-based frontend, showcasing enterprise-grade software architecture patterns. The backend employs a sophisticated inheritance hierarchy with an abstract Automobile base class serving as the foundation for three concrete derived classes: ElectricCar, GasCar, and DieselCar, each implementing vehicle-specific attributes and behaviors through polymorphism. The MaintenanceTask class utilizes composition and factory design patterns to create predefined maintenance operations with intelligent vehicle type compatibility validation, ensuring business logic enforcement at the data layer. The MaintenanceLibrary class acts as a central repository implementing CRUD operations with smart pointer management for memory safety and automatic resource cleanup. The system's core innovation lies in its intelligent task-vehicle compatibility matrix, where maintenance tasks automatically filter based on vehicle propulsion typesâ€”for instance, oil changes and transmission services are restricted to internal combustion engines (gas and diesel), while battery inspections are exclusive to electric vehicles, and universal tasks like tire rotation and brake inspection apply across all vehicle types. The web frontend leverages a RESTful API architecture built with a custom lightweight HTTP server implementation that handles routing, request parsing, JSON serialization, and static file serving, providing endpoints for vehicle management (/api/vehicles), task management (/api/tasks), and task assignment operations. The user interface employs Bootstrap 5.3.0 for responsive design with Font Awesome icons, implementing a class-based JavaScript architecture that manages real-time dashboard statistics, form validation, modal dialogs for task assignment, and asynchronous API communication using modern fetch() methods. The build system utilizes CMake for cross-platform compilation with C++17 standard compliance, optimization flags (-O2), pthread support for potential future multithreading, and conditional Google Test integration for unit testing. Key technical features include automatic ID generation for vehicles and tasks, smart pointer-based memory management preventing memory leaks, form-encoded data parsing for HTTP requests, JSON response formatting with proper escaping, real-time UI updates reflecting backend state changes, and graceful error handling with user-friendly notifications. The architecture demonstrates separation of concerns with clear boundaries between business logic (C++ classes), data persistence (in-memory storage with smart pointers), API layer (HTTP server with routing), and presentation layer (responsive web interface), making it easily extensible for future enhancements such as database integration, authentication systems, scheduling capabilities, or mobile application development through the existing RESTful API endpoints.
